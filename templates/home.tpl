              Constantly hard and challenging.

              Let's be honest though: we like challenge.

            <h2>The virtuous circle of mutual help</h2>
            <p>
              There is no shame in saying that programming is hard but
              when it becomes frustrating it stops to be fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ten times difference in productivity means community fragmentation. Fragmentation is poison but mutual help is the antidote.
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot of great men and women already entered the virtuos circle of mutual help and many others would but can't.

              Some reasons preventing developers from getting involved actively in the community:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>depression</li>

            <h2>Four little bastards</h2>
            <p>
              In 2014 I pleasantly saw a rising attention around depression, discrimination and equal opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
               <a href="http://twitter.com/kayladnls">Kayla Daniels</a> wrote <a href="http://codemanifesto.com/">Code Manifesto</a> and made this <a href="">talk about diversity</a> for which I'm really greatful.
            </p>

            <p>
              Beside what Kayla and others fight against, there are some other issues that I list here:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>living and working in an isolated environment</li>
                <li>not being a native English speaker</li>
                <li>not beloging to the American culture</li>
                <li>feeling old</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              These 4 little bastards are quite underrated issues causing a lot of fragmentation in any IT community. They are not strictly related to discrimination but, unfortunately, they produce similar effects: shame, fear and, the worse, isolation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many Europeans suffer them but few are ready to admit it. Shame is a beast.
            </p>

            <p>
              Of course, I've got them all and I'm still dealing with most of them. Obviously the last point is not going to be any better in the future :-)
            </p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              There are some historical considerations to take in account about those 4 little bastards.
            </p>

            <p>
              An Italian developer born in the 70's, as I am, had his/her first computer when he was about 18 year old and probably didn't attend any computing class.
            </p>

            <p>
              Likely he doesn't speak English very well despite the fact that it was usually (badly) taught at school for an average of 8 years.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Italian culture is not very computing savvy, even nowadays, and the average size of companies is ridiculously small.
            </p>

            <p>
              These factors create a isolated environments and it can be hard to get in touch with other developers and to be contaminated by new ideas and experiences. Because of that specialization is also hard to achive.
            </p>

            <p>
              For other European countries the situation can harder: until 1989 many were under the Soviet Union which wasn't exactly free and open. It was only 25 years ago.

            <h2>About PHP-AID</h2>
            <p>
               For now PHP-AID is just an idea to develop accordingly with these principles:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                 PHP-AID should grow as a tool to fight isolation, a double claw to unnail barriers.
              </li>
              <li>
                PHP-AID must be a welcoming environment in which being a comprehensive and tolerant person truly embracing <a href="http://codemanifesto.com/">Code Manifesto</a> should be more important than being an excellent developer.
              </li>

              <li>
                PHP-AID shouldl cooperate with other complementary projects like PHP Women.
              </li>
            <ul>

          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="home-content">
            <h2>Targets for PHP-AID</h2>

            <p>
               <span class="dropcap">1st</span> I'd like to see a round table of people willing to design the destiny of PHP-AID because it shouldn't be the result of just one person's ideas.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="dropcap">2nd</span> PHP-AID should ease the cooperation between people and the birth of teams of developers.
            </p>

            <p>
               One way to reach the second target could be the creation of a marketplace for potential or already existent opensource projects in which the demand for help meets the offer of help.
            </p>

              I use some elementary projects of mine as guinea pigs to see if the idea makes sense.
